# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the 
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>.
Review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. You can use this template for free 
with the Mule Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case
As a Salesforce admin I want to aggregate users from two Salesforce Instances and compare them to see which users can only be found in one of the two and which users are in both instances. 

For practical purposes this Template will generate the result in the format of a CSV Report sent by mail.

This Template should serve as a foundation for extracting data from two systems, aggregating data, comparing values of fields for the objects, and generating a report on the differences. 

As implemented, it gets users from two instances of Salesforce, compares by the email address of the users, and generates a CSV file which shows users in A, users in B, and Users in A and B. The report is then emailed to a configured group of email addresses.

# Considerations

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**



## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work.

### FAQ

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.









# Run it!
Simple steps to get Salesforce and Salesforce User Aggregation running.


## Running On Premises
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.


### Where to Download Anypoint Studio and the Mule Runtime
If you are a newcomer to Mule, here is where to get the tools.

+ [Download Anypoint Studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio)
+ [Download Mule runtime](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise)


### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your
Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click **Open**.


### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`
+ Click `Run`


### Running on Mule Standalone
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties and run your app with the corresponding environment variable. To follow the example, this is `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub
While creating your application on CloudHub (or you can do it later as a next step), go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the **mule.env**.
Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcuseraggregation` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sfdcuseraggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and the report will be sent to the emails configured.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub
Studio provides an easy way to deploy your template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so check this


## Properties to Configure
To use this template, configure properties (credentials, configurations, etc.) in the properties file or in CloudHub from Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties. The sections that follow list example values.
### Application Configuration
**HTTP Connector configuration**
+ http.port `9090` 

**SalesForce Connector configuration for company A**
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**SalesForce Connector configuration for company B**
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`


**SMTP Services configuration**
+ smtp.host `smtp.gmail.com`
+ smtp.port `587`
+ smtp.user `exampleuser@gmail.com`
+ smtp.password `ExamplePassword456`

**Mail details**
+ mail.from `exampleuser1@gmail.com`
+ mail.to `exampleuser2@gmail.com`
+ mail.subject `SFDC Users Report`
+ mail.body `Users report comparing users from SFDC Accounts`

# API Calls
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during aggregation.


# Customize It!
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template.

More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml


## config.xml
Configuration for connectors and configuration properties are set in this file. Even change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified are in properties file, which is the recommended place to make your changes. However if you want to do core changes to the logic, you need to modify this file.

In the Studio visual editor, the properties are on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records and finally formatting the output, in this case being a report.

Using Scatter-Gather component we are querying the data in different systems. After that the aggregation is implemented in DataWeave 2 script using Transform component.
Aggregated results are sorted by source of existence:

1. Users only in Salesforce A
2. Users only in Salesforce B
3. Users in both Salesforce A and Salesforce B

and transformed to CSV format. Final report in CSV format is sent to email, that you configured in mule.*.properties file.



## endpoints.xml
This is the file where you will found the endpoint to start the aggregation. This Template has an HTTP Inbound Endpoint as the way to trigger the use case.

### Trigger Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.



## errorHandling.xml
This is the right place to handle how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. 
This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
