# License Agreement
This template is subject to the conditions of the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/templates-examples/AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf">MuleSoft License Agreement</a>.

# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
As a Salesforce admin I want to aggregate users from two Salesforce Instances and compare them to see which users can only be found in one of the two and which users are in both instances. 

For practical purposes this Template will generate the result in the format of a CSV Report sent by mail.

This template serves as a foundation for extracting data from two systems, aggregating data, comparing values of fields for the objects, and generating a report on the differences. 

As implemented, it gets users from two instances of Salesforce, compares by the email address of the users, and generates a CSV file which shows users in A, users in B, and Users in A and B. The report is then emailed to a configured group of email addresses.

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**
<!-- Considerations (end) -->



## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work:

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>.
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>.

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault 
[ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, 
Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to 
use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. 
Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.









# Run it!
Simple steps to get this template running.
<!-- Run it (start) -->

<!-- Run it (end) -->

## Running On Premises
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

After this, to trigger the use case you just need to browse to the local http endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should browse to: `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the mails set.

### Where to Download Anypoint Studio and the Mule Runtime
If you are new to Mule, download this software:

+ [Download Anypoint Studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio)
+ [Download Mule runtime](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise)

**Note:** Anypoint Studio requires JDK 8.

### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click Open.
<!-- Importing into Studio (start) -->

<!-- Importing into Studio (end) -->

### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`.
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`.
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`.
+ Click `Run`.
<!-- Running on Studio (start) -->

<!-- Running on Studio (end) -->

### Running on Mule Standalone
Update the properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties, and run your app with a corresponding environment variable. In this example, use `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub
When creating your application in CloudHub, go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the mule.env value.
<!-- Running on Cloudhub (start) -->
Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdcuseraggregation` to trigger the use case you just need to browse to `http://sfdcuseraggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and the report will be sent to the emails configured.
<!-- Running on Cloudhub (end) -->

### Deploying a Template in CloudHub
In Studio, right click your project name in Package Explorer and select Anypoint Platform > Deploy on CloudHub.
<!-- Deploying on Cloudhub (start) -->

<!-- Deploying on Cloudhub (end) -->

## Properties to Configure
To use this template, configure properties such as credentials, configurations, etc.) in the properties file or in CloudHub from Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties. The sections that follow list example values.
### Application Configuration
<!-- Application Configuration (start) -->
**HTTP Connector Configuration**
+ http.port `9090`

# API Calls
<!-- API Calls (start) -->
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during aggregation.

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records and finally formatting the output, in this case being a report.

Using Scatter-Gather component we are querying the data in different systems. After that the aggregation is implemented in DataWeave 2 script using Transform component.
Aggregated results are sorted by source of existence:

1. Users only in Salesforce A
2. Users only in Salesforce B
3. Users in both Salesforce A and Salesforce B

and transformed to CSV format. Final report in CSV format is sent to email, that you configured in mule.*.properties file.<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (start) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (start) -->
This file provides the endpoint to start the aggregation. This Template has an HTTP Inbound Endpoint as the way to trigger the use case.

### Trigger Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.<!-- Default Endpoints XML (end) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (start) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (end) -->

## errorHandling.xml
<!-- Default Error Handling XML (start) -->
This file handles how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.<!-- Default Error Handling XML (end) -->
